A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project was devoloped using Flutter V2.0.5 and Dart 2.12.3 (null safety).
You'll need to install these versions to be able to execute the project.

For testing: simply run `flutter pub get` and then `flutter test` in the projects main path. Although these tests use code generation for creating mocks, these auto-generated files are included in the commit itself as they're not included in _gitignore_ file.

For running: run `flutter pub get` and then `flutter run` and choose your preferred device to execute the project.
